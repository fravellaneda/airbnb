## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Apart from the normal libraries in a data science project. I use to graph a library not very common but very useful to graph and interact with the data. Its name is [plotly.express] (https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:

1. ¿What is the distribution of the prices around Seattle?
2. ¿Is important the number of reviews to predict the price?
3. ¿Which features are more influential for predict the price?

This questions guided me throughout the data and all analysis that I did you will find in this repository. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

1. analysis.ipynb is the main file. In this notebook I explore the data looking for the question of the motivation. I use comments and markdown cells to guided the reader in the notebook step by step. How the notebook uses plotly.express sometimes the notebook not appear render in the repository. For visualize the cells you have to go [here] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fravellaneda/airbnb/blob/main/analysis.ipynb).
2. map.ipynb is the secondary file. In this notebook I plot a map for understand the distribution of the prices around seattle. To do that I use two techniques. For a correct visualization press [here] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fravellaneda/airbnb/blob/main/map.ipynb).

There is an additional `.geojson` file that save the information of the neighborhood polygons in Seattle.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main results of the analysis can be found at a medium post [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
